# Go Types

## ðŸ“˜ Description
The Go-Types repository provides an in-depth guide to working with types in the Go programming language. This repository is perfect for developers looking to master Goâ€™s type system through practical examples and well-structured code snippets.

Key topics covered:

- Structs: Learn how to define and use custom data structures in Go.
- Nested Structs: Understand how to structure complex data with nested structs.
- Interfaces: Explore Goâ€™s approach to interfaces and polymorphism.
- Composition: Implement composition as an alternative to inheritance.
- Methods: Define and use methods associated with types.
- Custom Types: Create and work with user-defined types.
- JSON Handling: Learn how to marshal and unmarshal JSON data with Go types.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure
The project is organized into multiple sections for easy navigation and learning.

### **Main Files**
### Structs/
This folder contains examples demonstrating Goâ€™s struct capabilities:

- struct.go: Introduction to struct definitions and usage.
- structaninhada.go: Example of nested structs for complex data modeling.

### Interfaces/
This folder highlights Goâ€™s interface system:

- interface.go: Basic interface definition and implementation.
- tipointerface.go: Exploring empty interfaces and type assertions.

### Composition/
This section explains how Go achieves code reuse using composition:

- composicao.go: Demonstrates struct composition as an alternative to inheritance.
- pseudoheranca.go: Shows Goâ€™s approach to struct embedding.

### Methods/
This section covers how to define methods for custom types:

- metodos.go: Defining methods on struct types.

### Custom Types/
This section introduces user-defined types and their applications:

- meutipo.go: Example of creating and using custom types in Go.

### JSON Handling/
This section demonstrates how to handle JSON data in Go:

- json.go: Working with JSON serialization and deserialization.
